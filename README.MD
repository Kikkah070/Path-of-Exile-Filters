FILTER VERSIONS
--------------------------

Depending on your playstyle choose the correct filter for you. I suggest starting with Regular in the beginning of a new league and slowly move towards the more strict filters.

* Regular = Shows all rares except Tier 3 and lower. Still shows a lot of items, great for leveling.
* Semi-Strict = Shows all rares except Tier 3 and lower. Hides some items, great for the start of mapping.
* Strict = Shows all rares except Tier 2 and lower. Hides scrolls and chromatic recipe, great for use after completing a decent amount of maps
* Very-Strict = Hides all rares and useless currency. Only use this if you don't want to see that much on your screen.

*The Regular and Semi-Strict versions both have a Chaos Recipe variant of the filter, so you can decide to show those rares or not*

1. Download the latest filter from the "releases" section.
2. Extract the files using WinRar/7zip or a similar tool.
3. Paste the .filter files and Sound_File folder in your %userprofile%/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile
4. INGAME: Escape -> Options -> UI -> Scroll down -> Select one of the filters from the dropdown box.

*The Save_Files folder you can either delete or keep, as it only contains the .txt files to use on filterblade.xyz*
